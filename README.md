**Welcome!**

## BACKGROUND

My name is Margaret Chifwete. I have a background in Bsc Biotechnology and a Post Graduate Diploma in Health Research methods.
My interests are mainly in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics especially in human and animal health. 
Understanding how one can intergrate the knowledge of bioinformatics  in diagnosis and treatment of diseases can be very helpful.  Lots of lives can be saved  by associating and identifying relationships between the clinical data of patients with their genetic information. Moreover,getting to know the molecular marker responsible for a certain disease can help both medics,researchers and pharmacologists which makes curbing a disease more easier. This also applies to transmission patterns of various diseases;tracing their sources especially during outbreaks and epidemics can allow measures to be taken early to prevent further spread of the disease . Basically my inspiration in Bioinformatics to have an in-depth knowledge of how it can be used to understand disease biology and shared mechanisms which can be useful in treatment.

Currently, I am one of the Bioinformatics intern that recently joined the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics unit at ICIPE.Having been in a wet-lab before, and learnt how to generate biological data this is a great opportunity for me  to gain expertise in analysing the data and making sense out of it. Looking forward to learn,grow and thrive in the Bioinformatics field.

## VISION

My vision as I undertake this internship include:
1. To be conversant in programming languages and use of other useful Bionformatic tools such sequence analysis, proteomic which are cutting edge tools that will be relevant in understanding the genetic basis.
2. To understand and have a deep knowledge in biological data analysis.
3. To develop my career path in Bioinformatics.
4. To interact and network with other bioinformaticians.
