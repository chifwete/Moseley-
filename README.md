Welcome!

Chifwete is one of the Bioinformatics intern that recently joined the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics unit at ICIPE. The unit aims at mentoring and training students on molecular biology and bioinformatics.

My vision as I undertake this internship include:
a) To learn programming languages and use of other useful tools.
b) To understand and have a deep knowledge in biological data analysis.
c) To develop my career path in Bioinformatics.
d) To interact and network with other bioinformaticians.
