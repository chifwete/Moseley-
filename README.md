**Welcome!

My name is Margaret Chifwete. I have a background in Bsc Biotechnology and a Post Graduate Diploma in Health Research methods.
My interests are mainly in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics. 
Currently, I am one of the Bioinformatics intern that recently joined the Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics and Biostatistics unit at ICIPE.Having been in a wet-lab before, and learning how to generate biological data this is a great opportunity for me  to gain expertise in analysing the data and making sense out of it. Looking forward to learn,grow and thrive in the Bioinformatics field.

My vision as I undertake this internship include:
a) To learn programming languages and use of other useful Bionformatic tools such sequence analysis, proteomics,transcriptomics which are cutting edge tools that will be relevant in understanding the genetic basis.
b) To understand and have a deep knowledge in biological data analysis.
c) To develop my career path in Bioinformatics.
d) To interact and network with other bioinformaticians.
